# Pediatric FDOPA Pipeline

### Updating lesions from FLAIR MRI ###

## About

Our pipeline is designed to assist nuclear medicine physicians in their clinical workflow by extracting both static (T/S and T/N) and dynamic parameters (slope, time to peak, and dynamic slope ratio) from 18F-FDOPA PET images of pediatric brain tumors. Implemented using open-source Python libraries, the pipeline automates the entire process from coregistration to parameter extraction. Additionally, we propose a method for visualizing intra-tumoral regions, providing a comprehensive tool for clinical evaluation and decision-making.
## Dipendencies 
The software code has been developed using Python 3.11 version, running in Centos 7.
## Installation
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

`pip install --user nibabel antspyx matplotlib pandas` 

`git clone https://github.com/tfunck/pediatric_fdopa_pipeline`

## Input Data formatting

All data must be formatted according to the [BIDS PET](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.html) format.

PET image file:

`<study_directory>/sub-<subject_id>/pet/sub-<subject_id>_pet.nii.gz`

PET header file:

`<study_directory>/sub-<subject_id>/pet/sub-<subject_id>_pet.json`

MRI image file:

`<study_directory>/sub-<subject_id>/anat/sub-<subject_id>_T1w.nii.gz`

### Example
`data/sub-1/pet/sub-1_pet.nii.gz`

`data/sub-1/pet/sub-1_pet.json`

`data/sub-1/anat/sub-1_T1w.nii.gz`

## PET .json header
Our pipeline takes in input both static and dynamic PET scans. For dynamic PET the required fields are:

* 'FrameDuration'
* 'FrameTimesStart'

### Example contents of a PET .json header :

{

	"FrameDuration": [
		60,
		60,
		60],
		
	"FrameTimesStart": [
		0,
		60,
		120]

}

### How to run:
* Organize your data as above
  
* Download (or git clone) this repository
  
* Add a repository 'tumor_MRI', containing the mask of MRI lesion for each subjcet
  
* pediatric_fdopa_pipeline.py contains calls for all submodules.

Current framework is organized in five interconnected modules: Preprocessing, Coregistration, Region selection, Tumour segmentation, Static and Dynamic parameters extraction.

### Command to run from terminal: 
python3 pediatric_fdopa_pipeline.py -i /Path for input data directory -o/Path for output file directory

### User options

* -i : Path for input data directory
* -o : Path for output file directory
* -s : Path for stereotaxic template file; default=atlas/mni_icbm152_t1_tal_nlin_asym_09c.nii.gz
* -a : Path for stereotaxic label file; default='atlas/dka.nii.gz'
* -vol_MRI : Path for flair tumor masks; default='tumor_MRI/'

### Pre-Processing:
FLAIR MRI tumour volumes were segmented using MRIcroGL's semi-automatic region-growing tool, with central lesion portions as seeding points. Parameters such as VOI radius and initial point difference were adjusted for refinement, and the resulting binary images were saved as NIfTI files. A closing operator was used to improve mask uniformity.
To address significant non-encephalic uptake in [18F]F-DOPA PET images, skull stripping was performed on FLAIR MRI using FSL's BET tool, creating masks to isolate the brain.
The Desikan-Killiany atlas automated the identification of white matter and corpus striatum regions. Erosion of white matter volumes was done to mitigate spillover effects and separate reference region signals from adjacent structures.
### Coregistration:
This module coregisters the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), Desikan-Killiany atlas (DKA) and all FLAIR MRI volumes into the PET coordinate space. The process involves two main steps: aligning the MRI volume with the PET and then aligning the MNI atlas with the MRI.
The MRI volume is aligned with the PET volume using Python’s ANTspy library.
A rigid body (6 parameter) linear transformation is applied since both images are from the same subject.
The MNI atlas is aligned to the MRI using a non-linear transformation with ANTs.
MNI to PET coordinate transformations are then applied to the DKA and tumor VOI, warping them into PET coordinate space using nearest neighbor interpolation.
### Region Selection:
We focused on individuals with hemispheric or subtentorial tumours. For hemispheric tumours, we employed the white matter of the opposite hemisphere as the reference region and verified this selection in roi_selection.py by overlaying the flair tumour masks on key brain regions. Subtentorial tumours were consistently analyzed using the left hemisphere as the reference region.
### Tumor Segmentation:
We first checked within the flair lesion the values of T/S and T/N. If both were < 1, the pipeline skips the segmentation and employes the flair tumor masks. Otherwise, we find tumor voxels by employing a thresholding algorithm:
* SUVr = PET / max(ref)
* tumor_voxels = SUVr > 1
### Static and Dynamic parameters extraction:
Static parameters include the tumor-to-striatum ratio and tumor-to-reference ratio. Dynamic parameters, derived from the Time Activity Curve (TAC), include time-to-peak, tumor curve slope, striatum curve slope, and dynamic slope ratio.

### Warning

The pipeline does not keep track of whether upstream files (e.g., *file_1*) are older than downstream files (e.g., *file_n*). Hence, if you delete an upstream file and rerun the pipline, it will not create a new version of the downstream file.

**pipeline_stage_1** --> *file_1* --> ...(more stages in pipeline)... --> **pipeline_stage_n** --> *file_n*

If you wish to re-run an analysis for a given set of subjects, it is recommended to delete the entire subject directories (or move them to a backup location) and re-run the entire pipeline for those subjects. This way there is no risk of ending up with out of date downstream files that do not reflect the new information in the upstream files that they depend on.
